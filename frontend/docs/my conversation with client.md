- App idea similar to: https://autoshorts.ai
- Need: high-converting landing page + payments + login/signup
- After payment → route to dashboard that says: "Service is currently down due to high traffic"
- Purpose: test MVP funnel

[Jane Alan | 1:39 AM]
- It would actually just be a landing page that can log in, sign up and accept payments.

[Kush Jariwala | 1:52 AM]
- Oh okay, I thought it was related to this project:
  https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~022013051017371271235
  That's why I asked for details. No problem.
- I would definitely like to work on it.

To scope it properly and move fast, tell me:
1) Payment: Stripe? one-time or subscription? pricing + currency?
2) Pages/flow: landing page sections + what happens after payment (instant access or email approval)?
3) Auth: email/password, magic link, or Google login?
4) Dashboard: only "service down" message, or anything else (waitlist, support, FAQs, refund/cancel)?
5) Design/branding: logo, colors, copy, domain (or keep it clean/simple for MVP)?

- Once I have this, I’ll send a clear MVP scope + timeline.

[Jane Alan | 1:59 AM]
- Yes it’s related to that.
- I’m building out the backend and wanted to get something out for a test before backend is completed.
- Opportunity to build the user dashboard in near future too.
- What you listed above pretty much covers what I want.

[Kush Jariwala | 2:24 AM]
- Great, that’s clear.
- I can build Phase 1 now (landing page + signup/login + payments + basic dashboard with "service down" message),
  then we can build the real user dashboard once your backend is ready.

Quick items to confirm so I can quote and start:
1) Payments: Stripe or anything else? One-time or subscription? Pricing and currency?
2) Target budget range for Phase 1 MVP? If yes, I’ll tailor scope to fit.
3) Fixed-price with milestones OR hourly (with weekly cap)?

- Once you confirm, I’ll send clear quote + timeline.

[Jane Alan | 3:06 AM]
- Subscription on Stripe
- USD; allow local currency in GBP or any other country
- Provide quote for this MVP based on requirements discussed

[Kush Jariwala | 3:32 AM]
- Perfect, thanks.
- Since exact scope can still expand a bit, I normally work hourly ($25/hour) so you only pay for time spent.
  We can set a weekly cap so you control spend.
- If you prefer fixed-price, share the budget you want to stay within for this MVP and I’ll tailor scope to fit it.
  (In my opinion, this is beneficial for you as a client for a landing page project like this.)

[Jane Alan | 3:34 AM]
- How many hours will you spend building this? I believe the scope is well mapped out.

[Kush Jariwala | 3:57 AM]
- You removed this message.

[Kush Jariwala | 5:08 PM]
- Hey Dami, sorry for the confusion.
- Yesterday, I accidentally shared quotation details meant for another client (real estate project).
- For your landing page MVP, the quotation is $300.
- Apologies again for the inconvenience, waiting for your confirmation.

[Kush Jariwala | 6:28 PM]
- Hey Dami, I’m waiting for your reply.
  Is there anything you would like clarification on from my side?

[Jane Alan | 7:37 PM]
- Thanks for clarifying that. I am reviewing this.
- The quote looks good to start.
- Just wondering what the UI would look like. I haven't seen any reference of your work building landing pages.

[Kush Jariwala | 7:46 PM]
- Got it, Dami.
- If you have branding (logo, name, color palette, font preferences, or a theme you like), share it and I’ll match it.
- If not, tell me the vibe (clean/minimal, bold/high-contrast, dark mode, etc.) and 1–2 colors you like.
- Once I have that, I’ll create a quick UI prototype (like the Instagram scraper prototype) so you can review
  before I build full MVP.

[Kush Jariwala | 5:13 AM]
- Loom video: https://www.loom.com/share/52e9c214a08d48bf952ea07b67c3fbe4
- Prototype hosted on Vercel:
  https://damiupworklandingpagedemo-7vbxb5g6y-kushs-projects-22f7df1e.vercel.app/
- Looking forward to your confirmation so we can start.
- Thank you.

[System Note]
- Authentication Required

[Jane Alan | 5:46 AM]
- Thank you for sharing. I reviewed the video and the demo page looks good.
- I’m analyzing multiple software brands in this space and consolidating best landing page elements.
- What you have is a good start. I will provide feedback and things I need to be added.
- I may come up with a generated design and share it tomorrow.

SATURDAY, JAN 31
================================================================================

[Jane Alan | 11:14 PM]
- I’m still working on it.
- So far I like the simplicity of facelessreels.com
- And the high conversion features from:
  https://clippie.ai/

[Kush Jariwala | 4:13 AM]
- I checked both.

FacelessReels:
- Strong simplicity: clear promise, one main CTA, proof + 3-step flow easy to scan.
- Catch: pricing isn’t obvious upfront + Trustpilot reputation looks weak.
  If we go minimal like that, we should add stronger trust signals.

Clippie:
- Built to convert: lots of examples + very clear pricing.
- Catch: can feel busy/salesy, may turn off skeptical buyers.

Suggested hybrid:
- Simple hero (headline + CTA + quick proof)
- Small examples gallery + clean pricing
- Solid trust layer (support, clear policy/guarantee, what happens after checkout)

P.S. Another brand: https://faceless.so/
- Very strong UI; "Try the Faceless Studio" feature stood out.
- That level of UI/UX needs higher budget (more design + dev effort).
- I can share more brands if you want.

[Jane Alan | 4:33 AM]
- Yes please share.
- I want a simple and straightforward design like facelessreels but with some clippie elements:
  show how the app works + internal studio preview.
- faceless.so is too much, not what we want.
- Take best part of clippie (sneak preview of app), add a few sections into facelessreels layout.

Important:
- User must pay first before they sign up:
  after payment → go to dashboard.

- Let me know if request is clear or if you have further questions.

[Kush Jariwala | 12:57 PM]
- Perfect, thanks Dami.

Plan:
- FacelessReels-style simple layout
- Add a few Clippie-style "sneak preview / studio" sections (without making page busy)

Pay-first flow:
- CTA → Stripe subscription checkout → after successful payment user creates account → then dashboard

Next step:
- Please send Upwork offer so I can start under active contract.

Recommended (fixed price $300 MVP):
- Milestone 1 ($150, funded to start):
  Landing page layout + sections + "studio/sneak preview" sections + pricing section
- Milestone 2 ($150):
  Stripe subscription checkout + pay-first flow (Checkout → create account → dashboard) + deployment

- Once Milestone 1 is funded, I’ll start immediately.
- After Milestone 1 approved, we fund Milestone 2 and finish.
