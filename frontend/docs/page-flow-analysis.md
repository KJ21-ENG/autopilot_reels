## Changes Made:
- **Moved Testimonials AFTER How It Works & Demo Video**
  - Why: Testimonials hit harder AFTER showing the product works
  - People trust reviews more when they already understand the product
  
- **Demo Video moved earlier (before Testimonials)**
  - Why: Visual demonstration builds understanding before social proof
